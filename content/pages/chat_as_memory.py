"""
In the previous exercises, we have been using the completion interface to interact with the LLM. 
While it is necessary to understand completion to understand how an LLM works, it is not the usual way we interact with
LLMs.

In fact, if you asked most people about LLMs, they would almost always associate them with chatbots.
Chatbots do provide a user experience that favours LLM's natural language understanding and generation capabilities,
however in the next few sections we will explore other aspects of a chat which enhance the capabilities of a LLM.

"""
This will be our first interaction with the chat interface in this course. For educational purposes,
some aspects of the chat interface may not be in line with the usual chat interface you are familiar with.

For example, there's already some messages in the chat and I've already provided you with a prompt to put in.
Try entering it. You will notice that after you submit your response, the chat will provide you with the next
step to take. Following this allows you to complete the exercise, even though you are not compelled to do so.

"""
At the end of the chat, you will be asked to query the assistant on its name. The assistant answers it correctly - Bob.

This wouldn't be possible in the completion interface as the LLM doesn't have any record of previous interactions.
You can probably tell what is happening here. The chat stores the history of the conversation, and the LLM uses it
as _context_ to complete the response.

The chat interface also provides a way to reset your conversation and to browse previous chats, which are similar
to the completion interface. You can take some time to get used to the chat interface.

"""
When attending hearings or meetings, many lawyers stick to pen or paper, 
or use some word processing software or note-taking software to take down notes. 
As they are taken down quickly, they often messy and hard to read.

Chat applications don't look like they should be used for note taking. 
(They are conversations, right?) 
However, when combined with a large language model, you can find new and surprising uses.

Were you satisfied with the summary provided by the LLM?

there are short forms, spelling errors and even possible industry terms you may not expect the LLM to be familiar with.

st.header("Conclusion", divider=True)
"""
In this section, we discovered the power of prompt engineering for lawyers using chat interfaces. 
By treating chat as a data storage tool, we can expand the capabilities of LLMs, by for example, taking notes using
burst of information taken in real time.

In the next section, we will expand on the idea of chat to introduce another concept which makes LLMs more powerful.

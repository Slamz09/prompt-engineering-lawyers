"""
It's a course to explore what prompt engineering is and its possibilities. 
At the end of the course, you will:
 
* Craft prompts that are clear, concise and effective in generating the response you want
* Discover new ways to make large language models work harder for you
* Evaluate the quality of the generated text
* Understand better how to effectively use large language models like ChatGPT, GPT4, Claude, 
Bard, PaLM and many others through prompt engineering.

This course is also focused on **application**. 
It is designed for lawyers and other professionals who want to use prompt engineering in a variety of tasks in the 
legal domain. 
The examples and the tasks are focused on the legal domain.

"""
If you are a lawyer, and you want to stay ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving world of legal technology,
this is a great way to learn about prompt engineering. (Impress your colleagues!)

If you are not a lawyer, but you want to know how prompt engineering and large language models can affect
legal work, this is a good way to gain exposure.

One of the most important features I wanted is the ability to *experiment*. The widgets in this course
allow a user to input any prompt, so you can follow the course, experiment with your own input or 
compare two prompts to compare how effective they are.

Let's have fun! :the_horns:

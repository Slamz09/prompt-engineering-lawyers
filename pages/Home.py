"""
It's a course to explore what prompt engineering is and its possibilities. 
At the end of the course, you will:

* Craft prompts that are clear, concise and effective in generating the response you want
* Discover new ways to make large language models work harder for you
* Evaluate the quality of the generated text
* Understand better how to effectively use large language models like ChatGPT, GPT4, Claude, 
Bard, PaLM and many others through prompt engineering.

This course is also focused on **application**. 
It is designed for lawyers and other professionals who want to use prompt engineering in the legal domain. 
The examples and the tasks are focused on the legal domain.

If you are a lawyer, and you want to stay ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving world of legal technology,
this is a great way to learn about prompt engineering. (Impress your colleagues!)

If you are not a lawyer, but you want to know how prompt engineering and large language models can affect
legal work, this is a good way to gain exposure.

One of the most important features I wanted is the ability to *experiment*. The widgets in this course
allow a user to input any prompt, so you can follow the course, experiment with your own input or 
compare prompts.

Let's have fun! :the_horns:

"""
This is not that kind of course where you open it and just read. A lot of effort goes into researching, 
designing and implementing the exercises. This includes coding work to make the exercises interactive.

While the first iteration of this course was free, I have decided to make it a paid course. Some of the 
more advanced exercises (marked ":red[:material/lock:]") will require a subscription. Before making 
payment, you can try out the free exercises (marked ":violet[:material/lock_open:]") to see if this course is for you.
Once you get full access, you will be able to access all the exercises (marked ":green[:material/lock:]" and
":green[:material/lock_open:]").

Once you get full access, you also get access to updates and new exercises that I will be adding in the future.

Ready to get started? :rocket:
